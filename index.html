			<h1>I'M KRISTELLE MAY F. <span>ETAC</span></h1>
			<p>
				Hi there! I'm Kristelle May Etac. I'm a BSIT student, and this is my little corner of the internet.
				<div>
				Join me as I share my info, interests, and insights. Let's connect and explore together!
				<br>
				I am 20 years old. I was reared in Muntinlupa City, where I was born and raised.
				<br>
				This city not only shaped my personality, but it also taught me important life
				<br>
				lessons like working hard, persevering, and deeply appreciating the simple things in life.
				<br>
				Recent graduate of Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Muntinlupa's
				<br>
				Associate in Computer Technology program.
				<br>
				I've had the honor of exploring subjects that have broadened my view on the route I'm pursuing throughout my academic year.
				<br>
				<br>
				<p> The simplest things in life frequently bring the greatest happiness. Those tiny things are my favorite pastimes and interests.
				<br>
				Reading is one of my greatest hobbies. There is nothing that compares to the enchantment of opening 
				<br>
				book and entering an entirely different world. I also enjoy watching foreign dramas,
				<br>
				which is another pastime. I use my free time to start or complete watching dramas or series whenever
				<br>
				I have free time or when I'm feeling stressed. I also love drinking sodas, milk tea, and coffee.
				<br>
				I enjoy looking through my online shopping app and social media accounts.
